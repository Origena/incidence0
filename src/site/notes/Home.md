## No-Nonsense Evidence-based HIV Prevention Approach

**Welcome to the archive of the Incidence 0 blog**

The Incidence 0 blog started on March 20, 2011 as the field of HIV prevention was at a turning point in its history. I managed, wrote and edited this blog during my spare time. Views expressed did not necessarily reflect or represent those of the organisations I was working for or contribute to, as a matter of facts, this would have been surprising then, and now, but creation is in contradiction.

**Back in 2011**, the succession of encouraging results that was coming out of the clinical trials of NPTs - New Prevention Technologies (Circumcision, Microbicides, PrEP), and a growing recognition that treatment also contribute to prevention of HIV transmission were raising new hopes. But these recent advances often raised more questions than they answered and, happening on the background of an economic recession, created confusion and dilemmas amongst advocates, funders and beneficiaries as to what should be done next to successfully contain and quell the HIV epidemic.

With the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals ([[MDG\|MDG]]) then under review (see below) and a prevention revolution at the heart of the next [[UNAIDS\|UNAIDS]] strategic plan for 2011-2015, it was time to have a much needed conversation about the future of HIV prevention if we want to lead a successful HIV prevention revolution.

This was what this blog aimed to contribute to. It formally ended on March 6, 2018, although posting had largely dried out by the end of 2015. Times had changed, new voices and faces needed to take front stage.

I am republishing it in a new space and, as I review it post by post, I aim to reflect on my thoughts at the time of writing and briefly comment on any changes in my views or in the field of HIV prevention. I'll also add clarifying notes when needed. This exercise promises to be insightful.

There are over 50 posts to go through and this will take some time, bear with me and let's star with the [[2011/Time for a conversation about HIV prevention\|opening post]], dated March 20, 2011.

>"New HIV infections are declining steadily, led by sub-Saharan Africa. In 2009, an estimated 2.6 million people were newly infected with HIV—a drop of 21 per cent since 1997, when new infections peaked. Thanks to increased funding and the expansion of major programmes, the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy for HIV or AIDS increased 13 fold from 2004 to 2009. By end-2009, 5.25 million people were receiving such treatment in low- and middle-income countries — an increase of over 1.2 million people since December 2008. As a result, the number of AIDS-related deaths declined by 19 per cent over the same period."

>- 34 million people were living with HIV. 
>- 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV Worldwide.
>- 1.7 million people died from AIDS-related causes worldwide, 24% fewer deaths than in 2005.
>- More than 8 million people living with HIV had access to antiretroviral therapy.  The number of people accessing HIV treatment increased by 63% from 2009 to 2011. In 10 low- and middle-income countries, more than 80% of those eligible are receiving antiretroviral therapy. However, 7 million people eligible for HIV treatment still do not have access.
