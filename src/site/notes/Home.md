# No-Nonsense Evidence-based HIV Prevention Approach

## Welcome to the archive of the Incidence 0 blog

This blog started on March 20, 2011 as the field of HIV prevention was at a turning point in its history.

The succession of encouraging results that was coming out of the clinical trials of New Prevention Technologies (Circumcision, Microbicides, PrEP) and a growing recognition that treatment also contribute to prevention of HIV transmission were raising new hopes. But these recent advances often raised more questions than they answered and, happening on the background of an economic recession, created confusion and dilemmas amongst advocates, funders and recipients as to what should be done next to successfully contain and quell the HIV epidemic.

With the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals then under review and a prevention revolution at the heart of the next UNAIDS strategic plan for 2011-2015, it was time to have a much needed conversation about the future of HIV prevention if we want to lead a successful HIV prevention revolution.

This was what this blog aimed to contribute to. It formally ended on March 6, 2018, although posting had largely dried out by the end of 2015. Time had changed, new voices and faces needed to take front stage.

I am republishing it in a new space and, as I review it post by post, I aim to reflect on my thoughts at the time of writing and comment on any changes in my views or in the field of HIV prevention. This exercise promises to be insightful.

Bear with me!

## What was it all about?

*Here was the opening post.*

HIV prevention as we know it and have done it for the last 30 years is failing to put an end to the HIV epidemic. At best current prevention strategies appear to be containing HIV incidence at a rate of 2.7 million new infections a year after a peak at 3.5 million in 1996.

The recent acknowledgment that there is more to HIV prevention than the ABC of behaviour change and condoms and that key vulnerable populations have been largely ignored by prevention interventions (injecting drug users, men who have sex with men) is a welcome but late awakening.

Nevertheless, thirty years into the epidemic and in the absence of a cure or any other efficient means to protect oneself, there are still men and women who cannot or will not use condoms in situations where they are at risk of being infected. The reasons behind putting oneself at risk are multiple, complex and often beyond human rational decision making or their control.

In trying to address each of them, often in turn, independently and above all within the narrow epidemiological context of HIV, attempts at preventing HIV infection have resulted in limited outcomes and the fragmentation of the scarce resources allocated to target a global epidemic.

To date, of the prevention interventions tested in clinical trials, only four have shown a positive outcome: male circumcision, a complex and costly combination vaccine, an anti-retroviral-based microbicide whose efficacy hinges on adherence and a daily oral Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis using antiretrovirals commonly used to treat HIV-positive people.

Though these clinical studies open the way to more powerful interventions they are not good enough on their own to crush the current level of HIV infection and raise a number of questions and challenges.

incidence 0 aims at supporting and advancing the development of no-nonsense evidence-based HIV prevention interventions by providing a critical analysis of existing and new HIV prevention approaches and technologies.

No question should be ignored, no perspective disregarded. All opinions are worth considering because all those involved and dedicated to fighting the spread of HIV have one thing in common: they all want to bring HIV incidence down to zero.
